## Tools

### jlcsearch

`jlcsearch --help` for usage

Exposes a slightly less horrid interface to the JLC catalog.
By default only returns the first and cheapest basic/preferred part.
Any occurrences of `OHM` in the keyword will be replaced with the Î© symbol.



### jlcbomcheck

`jlcbomcheck --help` for usage

Tries to verify that the LCSC part codes in a kicad BOM file are correct.
This is done by checking that the case is roughly correct and that the description is neat enough.
Will also check component values when it thinks that it can.
**THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT EXHAUSTIVE**
